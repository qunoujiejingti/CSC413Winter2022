        "  1. (Part 1) Update `calculate_log_co_occurence()` to include the count for the 4th word in the sentence for diagonal entries. Remove text on needing to add 1 as it is already done in the code\n",
        "  2. (1.5) Removed the line defining unnecessary `loss` variable\n",
        "  2. (1.5) We added a gradient checker function using finite difference called `check_GloVe_gradients()`. You can run the specified cell in the notebook to check your gradient implementation for both the symmetric and asymmetric models before moving forward. \n",

The co-occurrence matrix can be *symmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$) if the order of the words do not matter, or *asymmetric* (i.e., $X_{ij} \\neq X_{ji}$) if we wish to distinguish the counts for when $i$-th word appears before $j$-th word. \n",

        "   Word embedding models such as GloVe attempt to learn a vector space where semantically similar words are clustered close together. However, they have been shown to learn problematic associations, e.g. by embedding \"man\" more closely to \"doctor\" than \"woman\" (and vice versa for \"nurse\"). To detect such biases in word embeddings, [\"Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases\"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal4230) introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). The WEAT test measures whether two _target_ word sets (e.g., {programmer, engineer, scientist, ...} and {nurse, teacher, librarian, ...}) have the same relative association to two _attribute_ word sets (e.g., man, male, ... and woman, female ...).\n",

In other words, assume that $logX_{jj}$ and $logX_{kk}$ are the same, the value of $logX_{ij}$ and $logX_{ik}$ may vary through different $j, k$. Therefore, one could play with the set of the attribute words so that by changing the value of $logX_{ij}$ and $logX_{ik}$, the WEAT association scores will change from word to word in the attributed set."
